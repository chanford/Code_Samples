Code that performs AES encryption/decryption
to compile: make hw6
usage:
hw6 encrypt -k=key -t=tablefile [file]
hw6 decrypt -k=key -t=tablefile [file]

tablefiles are located in the "grading" directory
test.sh is a script modified from the grading scirpt which has more detailed examples of running the program

.c/.h Files:
AES, performs AES encryption and decryption
Inverse, finds the inverse of a polynomial
KeyExpand, takes an inputted key and generates the sub-keys used by AES
Main, handles command line parameters
ModProd, finds the modular product of 2 polynpmials
TableCheck, checks a TableFile to verify that the contained tables are valid for use with AES
