a. For this section I reused code from Beej's guide to network programming http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/ . I used code from section 6.3 to make the base for the bindSocket function in each of my classes, and to make the sendto/recvfroms in Proxy's listenPort and Router's sendHello. In addition, I used this stackoverflow question http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4046616/sockets-how-to-find-out-what-port-and-address-im-assigned to find out how to get the port number from a bound socket in both class's bindSocket function.

b. This stage is complete. The proxy reads the config file, makes routers, and they communicate with each other.

c. My code for stage 1 could have problems communicating between different architecutres. The actual messages being sent are just character array's, which shouldn't have any problems since theres no endianess to worry about. But if the 2 computers use different character encoding, then they might not be able to interpret the messages correctly. additionally along with the message itself, each side also receives data about the sender in the recvfrom function. I would think that these fuctions are made to convert the data into whatever format  their current cpu architecture uses. But if they don't, then the 2 computers won't be able to send any replies to messages because they read the sneder data incorrectly
