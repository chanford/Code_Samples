a. This stage has no additional reused code.

b. This stage is complete. In addition, I inadvertently got started on project C and made each data flow have its own circuit instead of only having one circuit for the entire run of the program. However, as mentioned in the stage 3 readme, I was unable to make the 192.168.20X.2 ips work, so the router's ip addresses are the randomly assigned udp socket ips in the .out files. I apologize that I have these 2 items which probably make grading more difficult for you graders.

c. In a real TOR network, if the source talked to each router diretly, then observers would know what route the source is using. That would make it a lot easier to track their data. Using the partially  built circuits to extend the circuit makes it harder for observers to tell what path the source is using since its hard to map incoming packets to outgoing packets on TOR routers due to encryption and different circuit ids.
